\section{Abstract}
The paper presents a collage of results for the theory of gradient flow
from the textbook \cite{brezis1973ope} from Haïm Brézis.
The main focus is placed on maximal monotone multivalued
operators in $ \RR $-Hilbert spaces and on the
inhomogeneous generalised gradient descent evolution
equation. In particular we study the case of when
the maximal monotone multivalued operator is the sub differential
operator of a proper convex lower semi continuous function 
on a $ \RR $-Hilbert space.
The paper demonstrates at the end how the theory of gradient flow
is applied in machine learning with an example
in ridge regression.
