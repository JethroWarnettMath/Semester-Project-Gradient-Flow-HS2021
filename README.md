# Semester-Project-Gradient-Flow-HS2021

This is my Semester Project for the Fall Semester 2021 at ETH Zürich titled:
### Gradient Flows in Hilbert Spaces with Application

It was supervised by Prof. Dr. Figalli at ETH Zürich (https://people.math.ethz.ch/~afigalli/home)

The repository holds all the material that was used to write the project
